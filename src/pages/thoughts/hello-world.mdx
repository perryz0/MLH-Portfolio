Welcome to the **Thoughts** section. Posts here are minimal, static, and written in MDX.
You can drop code blocks, images, or components later if you feel like it.

## Features

This layout includes:
- Clean typography with proper spacing
- Back button to return to thoughts
- Formatted date display
- Summary text (if provided)
- Responsive design
- Matches your site's aesthetic

## Code blocks

You can also include code blocks:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

And **bold text** or *italic text* as needed.

## Lists

Sometimes you might want to list things:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Or numbered lists:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

The layout is designed to be ultra-minimal but much more polished than the default white page!
